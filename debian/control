Description: supersonic micro-framework for building cloud APIs - Python 2.x
 Falcon is a high-performance Python framework for building cloud APIs. It
 encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible
 while remaining highly effective.
 .
 Unlike other Python web frameworks, Falcon won't bottleneck your API's
 performance under highly concurrent workloads. Many frameworks max out at
 serving simple "hello world" requests at a few thousand req/sec, while Falcon
 can easily serve many more on the same hardware.
 .
 Falcon isn't very opinionated. In other words, the framework leaves a lot of
 decisions and implementation details to you.
 .
 Features:
  * Intuitive routing via URI templates and resource classes
  * Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response classes
  * Idiomatic HTTP error responses via a handy exception base class
  * DRY request processing using global, resource, and method hooks
  * Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks
  * 20% speed boost when Cython is available
  * Python 2.6, Python 2.7, PyPy and Python 3.3 support
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.
